Welcome to the **KB5FLS** antenna documentation hub.  
This site collects my notes, build guides, and experiments for ham radio antennas—especially multiband dipoles and portable/field setups.

## Dipole Antennas

Detailed projects and documentation for **fixed or semi-permanent** dipole antennas.

[**Browse all dipole antenna docs →**](/dipole-antennas/)

### Featured / Planned Topics

- **Multiband Trap Dipole (20m / 15m / 10m)**  
  Design using traps (toroids or PVC-based) to cover multiple HF bands on a single wire.

- **Center-Fed 20m Dipole (Reference Design)**  
  A simple, baseline 20m dipole used as a reference for comparing other designs.

- **Baluns & Chokes for Dipoles**  
  Notes on 1:1 current baluns, common-mode chokes, and how they impact SWR and pattern.

- **Trap Construction Notes**  
  Measurements, turns counts, toroid choices, PVC trap options, etc., focused on 100–200 W operation.

> **Tip:** As you create pages inside `docs/dipole-antennas/`, you can link them here:

> - `[20m Reference Dipole](/dipole-antennas/20m-reference-dipole/)`

## Portable Antennas

Projects focused on **lightweight, packable antennas** for portable ops, POTA, SOTA, or field testing.

[**Browse all portable antenna docs →**](/portable-antennas/)

### Featured / Planned Topics

- **Portable Vertical for HF**  
  Collapsible vertical with radials, tuned for quick deployment in parks.

- **End-Fed Half-Wave (EFHW) for Portable Use**  
  Matching unit, wire length choices, and band coverage trade-offs.

- **Quick-Deploy Dipole / Inverted-V**  
  Compact center support, feedline strain relief, and ways to use a single mast.

- **Pack List & Station Layout**  
  Notes on masts, stakes, feedline, guying, and how the antenna integrates with the radios and power.

> **Idea:** As you add markdown files under `docs/portable-antennas/`, link them here:
> - `[Portable Vertical](/portable-antennas/portable-vertical/)`
> - `[EFHW for POTA](/portable-antennas/efhw-pota/)`
